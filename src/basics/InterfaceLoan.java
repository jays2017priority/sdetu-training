//also remember to put in the methods that are a part of the interface
//can write the class outline

//the difference between a interface and inheritance is inheritace(is a) has a child class is a part of a parent class, and 
//interface(has a) says one class has a class, e.g. a EncapBank class has a InterfaceRate class or a Encapsul class has a 
//InterfaceRate class, if the EncapBank or Encapsul classes implements the InterfaceRate class. Both of the 
//two classes would be able to use the method in the interface as long as they implement it
public class InterfaceLoan implements InterfaceRate  {

	@Override
	public void setRate() {
		
		
	}

	@Override
	public void increaseRate() {
		
		
	}
